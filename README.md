# Spine-Injection-offers-Back-and-Neck-Pain-Relief-without-Surgery.-02-8315-8292
Back and neck pain can significantly impact your quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily tasks, enjoy activities, or even get restful sleep. For many individuals, especially those who have not found relief through medications, physical therapy, or chiropractic care, spine injections offer a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgery. At Crystal Radiology, we are proud to offer a trusted Spinal Injection service that provides targeted pain relief with precision and care.
In this article, we explain how spine injections work, what conditions they treat, their benefits, potential risks, and why Crystal Radiology is the preferred provider for spinal pain management.
What Are Spine Injections?
Spine injections are procedures where anti-inflammatory medications, typically corticosteroids, are injected directly into specific areas of the spine to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. These injections are performed under the guidance of imaging technology, such as fluoroscopy, to ensure precise needle placement.
Unlike oral medications that affect the whole body, spinal injections deliver medication right where it’s needed most, offering faster and more effective relief.
Common Types of Spine Injections Offered at Crystal Radiology
1.	Epidural Steroid Injections (ESIs): Best for radiating pain due to disc problems or spinal stenosis.
2.	Facet Joint Injections: Ideal for localised back or neck pain caused by joint degeneration.
3.	Nerve Root Blocks: Used to identify and treat pain originating from specific nerves.
4.	Sacroiliac Joint Injections: Treat pain located in the lower back and buttocks caused by inflammation in the sacroiliac joint.
Each type of injection is tailored to the patient's specific condition and symptoms, based on clinical evaluation and imaging findings.
Are Spinal Injections Right for You?
You may be a good candidate for spine injections if:
•	You experience persistent back or neck pain that hasn’t improved with other treatments.
•	You have radiating symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your limbs.
•	You want to avoid or delay spine surgery.
•	Your condition is stable enough to benefit from conservative treatment.
At Crystal Radiology, our radiologists perform a thorough assessment and imaging review before recommending spinal injections. In many cases, patients experience significant pain relief that allows them to resume normal activities without the need for surgery.
What to Expect During a Spine Injection
Spinal injections at Crystal Radiology are performed in a sterile, outpatient setting using fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance for precise needle placement. The process typically includes:
•	Preparation: You’ll be asked to lie on your stomach or side. The injection site is cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic.
•	Imaging: CT imaging is used to guide the needle to the exact location.
•	Injection: A combination of a corticosteroid and local anesthetic is injected.
•	Recovery: You’ll rest for a short time and can usually go home the same day.
The entire procedure typically takes less than 30 minutes, and most patients return to normal activity within 24 hours.
Relief and Results
The effectiveness of spinal injections can vary from person to person, but many report:
•	Immediate or gradual pain relief
•	Improved mobility
•	Better sleep and quality of life
•	Ability to reduce reliance on pain medications
Pain relief may last from a few weeks to several months. If the pain returns, repeat injections may be considered at appropriate intervals.
Risks and Side Effects
While spine injections are considered safe and low-risk, potential side effects include:
•	Temporary soreness at the injection site
•	Flushing or a warm sensation
•	Headache
•	A mild increase in blood sugar
•	Insomnia
Serious complications are rare but may include bleeding, infection, or nerve injury. Our team takes all necessary precautions to minimise risks and ensure your safety.
